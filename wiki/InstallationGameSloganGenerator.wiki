= Introduction =

On this wiki page short instructions are given how to use the results of this project regarding game slogan generation.

= Use Cases =

  * Use the generator via demonstrator
  * Run the generator locally
  * Integrate the generator in some other project
  * Generate the analysis files used to develop the generator

= Use the generator via demonstrator =

Run the demonstrator, select game slogan generation and configure generation parameters

= Run the generator locally =

To run the generator locally you need the following:
  * Maven/Eclipse -project from [https://code.google.com/p/pp-slogan-generation/ pp-slogan-generation]
  * An Uby database (Tested for uby_open_3_0_0) from [https://code.google.com/p/uby/ Uby]
  * A custom database. An empty schema is located in the project under: "/src/main/resources/koch/sql dumb 2014 01 29 1700 no data"
  * (optionally) A Web1T corpus.
  * Correctly set constants in "de.koch.uim project.util.Constants"

While the generator only needs its parameters to run, the local GUI depends on additional constants. Please see class “de.koch.uim project.util.Constants”.
Edit the constants accordingly. The Javadoc gives examples. 
To run the applicaton run the main method of “de.koch.uim_project.main.Main”.

== Note ==
  * While the application will work with an empty custom database the absence of emotion words has a heavy impact on the quality of the generated slogans. In this case it is advisable to allways turn the emotion option to “None” to save performance.
  * The application will work without a web1t corpus but the quality of the generated slogans is lesser.
